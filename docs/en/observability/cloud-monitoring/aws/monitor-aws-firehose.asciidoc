Amazon Data Firehose is a popular service that allows you to send your VPC flow logs data to Elastic in minutes without a single line of code and without building or managing your own data ingestion and delivery infrastructure. Amazon Data Firehose Helps you answer questions like what percentage of your traffic is getting dropped, and how much traffic is getting generated for specific sources and destinations.
