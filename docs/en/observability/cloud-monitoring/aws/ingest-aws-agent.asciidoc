Elastic Agent is a single agent for logs, metrics, security data, and threat prevention. The Elastic Agent can be deployed in two different modes:

* Managed by Fleet — The Elastic Agent policies and lifecycle are centrally managed by the Fleet app in Kibana. The Integrations app also lets you centrally add integrations with other popular services and systems. This is the recommended option for most users.

* Standalone mode — All policies are applied to the Elastic Agent manually as a YAML file. This is intended for more advanced users. See Install standalone Elastic Agents (advanced users)for more information.
