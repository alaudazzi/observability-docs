Inventory provides a single place where you can observe the status of your entire ecosystem of hosts, containers and services at a glance, even just from logs. From there, you can monitor and understand the health of your entities, check what needs attention and start your investigations. 

<DocCallOut title="Note">
   The new Inventory requires the Elastic Entity Model (EEM). To learn more, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/elastic-entity-model" />.

Inventory is currently available for hosts, containers and services, but it will scale to support all of your entities.

The Elastic Entity Model currently supports the inventory experience (as identified by `host.name`, `service.name`, and `container.id`) located in data identified by the following index patterns:

- **Hosts**: Where `host.name` is set in `metrics-*`, `logs-*`, `filebeat-*`, and `metricbeat-*`

- **Services**: Where `service.name` is set in `filebeat*`, `logs-*`, `metrics-apm.service_transaction.1m*`, and `metrics-apm.service_summary.1m*`
  
- **Containers**: Where `container.id` is set in `metrics-*`, `logs-*`, `filebeat-*`, and `metricbeat-*`

Inventory allows you to:

- Filter for your entities to provide a high-level view of what you have leveraging your own tags and labels
- Drill down into any host, container or services to help you understand performance
- Debug resource bottlenecks with your service caused by their containers and the hosts they run on.
- Easily discover all entities related to the host, container or service you are viewing by leveraging your tags/labels

## Explore your entities

1. In your ((observability)) project, go to **Inventory** to open the entities catalog.

    If you have **Admin** privileges, the EEM will be turned on automatically. Otherwise, you need to ask someone with **Admin** privileges to turn on this feature under **Stack Management**.

1. In the search bar, search for your entities by name or type, for example `entity.type:service`.

For each entity, you can either view your data in Discover, or click the entity name and get a detailed view. For example, for an entity of type `service`, you get the following details:

- Overview
- Transactions
- Dependencies
- Errors
- Metrics
- Infrastructure
- Service Map
- Logs
- Alerts
- Dashboards

If you open an entity of type `host` or `container` that does not have infrastructure data, some of the visualizations will be blank and some features on the page will not be fully populated.

## Add entities to the inventory

Entities are added to the inventory through one of the following approaches:

**Add data** 
- Auto-detect logs and metrics 
    Detects hosts (with metrics and logs)
- Kubernetes
    Detects hosts, containers and services 
- Elastic APM / OpenTelemetry / Synthetic Monitor
    Detects services

**Associate existing service logs**
