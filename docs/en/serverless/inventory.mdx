Inventory provides a single place where you can observe the status of your entire ecosystem of hosts, containers and services at a glance, even just from logs. From there, you can monitor and understand the health of your entities, check what needs attention and start your investigations. 

<DocCallOut title="Note">
   The new Inventory requires the Elastic Entity Model (EEM). To learn more, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/elastic-entity-model" />.

Inventory is currently available for hosts, containers and services, but it can scale to support all of your entities.

- Hosts: Anything where `host.name` is set in a `metrics-*` or `logs-* index`
- Containers: Anything where `container.id` is set in a `metrics-*` or `logs-* index`
- Services: Anything where `service.name` is set in a `apm-*` or `logs-* index`

Inventory allows you to:

- Filter for your entities to provide a high-level view of what you have leveraging your own tags and labels
- Understand what needs attention by easily seeing what entities are alerting
- Drill down into any host, container or services with curated entity views to help you understand performance
- Debug resource bottlenecks with your service caused by their containers and the hosts they run on.
- Easily discover all entities related to the host, container or service you are viewing by leveraging your tags/labels

## Explore the entities catalog

1. In your ((observability)) project, go to **Inventory** to open the entities catalog.

    If you have **Admin** privileges, the EEM will be turned on automatically. Otherwise, you need to ask someone with **Admin** privileges to turn on this feature under **Stack Management**.

1. In the search bar, search for your entities by name or type, for example `entity.type:service`.

For each entity, you can either view your data in Discover, or click the entity name and get a detailed view. For example, for an entity of type `service`, you get the following details:

- Overview
- Transactions
- Dependencies
- Errors
- Metrics
- Infrastructure
- Service Map
- Logs
- Alerts
- Dashboards

If you open an entity of type `host` or `container` that does not have infrastructure data, some of the visualizations will be blank and some features on the page will not be fully populated.

## Add entities to the inventory

To add entities to the inventory, use one of the following approaches:

* Add data: TO_BE_COMPLETED
* Associate existing service logs. To learn how, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/add-logs-service-name" />.
