Elastic ((observability)) allows you to visualize infrastructure metrics to help diagnose problematic spikes,
identify high resource utilization, automatically discover and track pods,
and unify your metrics with logs and APM data.

Using ((agent)) integrations, you can ingest and analyze metrics from servers,
Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestrations, explore and analyze application
telemetry, and more.

Use the **Inventory page** to get a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure grouped by resource type.
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityAnalyzeHosts" />:
Use the **Hosts** page to get a metrics-driven view of your infrastructure backed by an easy-to-use interface called Lens.
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityDetectMetricAnomalies" />: Detect and inspect memory usage and network traffic anomalies for hosts and Kubernetes pods.

* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityMetricsReference" />: Learn about key metrics used for infrastructure monitoring.
* <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityMetricsFields" />: Learn about the fields required to display data in the Infrastructure UI.

By default, the Infrastructure UI displays metrics from ((es)) indices that
match the `metrics-*` and `metricbeat-*` index patterns. To learn how to change
this behavior, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessObservabilityConfigureInfraSettings">Configure settings</DocLink>.
